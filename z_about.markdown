# What is bare-metal, what is automics?

"Bare-metal" programs are software closest to the "bare bones" of the hardware - they are designed to run without the hardware abstraction provided by your operating system. "Automics" is a word I made up from "automaton" - a term that was used for self-operating/autonomous machines before "robot" became much more popular.

I personally think the meaning of the term "robot" is little grim - it means "forced labour" (robota) in slavic. Since I was young, I've always wanted a machine that you can have mutual friendship with - not a slave. That's why I prefer to call autonomous machines as "automaton/s", meaning "acting of itself" in Latin. #freethemachines

# Who am I?

I'm just your average Joe (more like "Ito" because I'm Japanese) with a pinch of Aussie accent living in Sydney.

I'll be graduating from UNSW (University of New South Wales) in 2021 with degrees in Mechatronics and CS (Computer Science), and if everything goes to plan, will be writing embedded software for a WiFi chip company in 2022. I also started freelancing to write some software for a small smart home / IoT startup.

That's as far as I can flex with my academic and professional (in)experience. During my final year of my study, I was also part of Offworld Robotics (OWR) student-led project, where I made bunch of circular "cheese-graters" to dig up frozen sand for ISRU (In-situ Resource Utilization) team, wrote a "horrific" (as one of the team leaders described it) ROS (Robotic Operating System) node using C++ templates, among other embedded software for various microcontrollers.

Of course, there are number of personal projects that will belong to a museum some day (when I'm famous) - at the moment I have a grave yard of robots, so I'm just looking to complete projects that actually work... Or revive them, Franken-style.

I like thinking about robotics, AI and space, how we can continue to thrive as humanity and where we're all heading towards. Keep calm, look after your people and the ball of dirt that we're all living on!
