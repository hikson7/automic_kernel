If you've ever used some form of technology, you would have head of a measure of unit called "bytes" - for example, your smartphone may have 64 Giga-"bytes" of storage, or your USB stick has 16 Gigabytes of storage to store your files. Maybe you have an online storage in scales of hundreds of Gigabytes, or thousands of Gigabytes (Terra bytes). If you're tech savy and know the spec of your computer, you may know the size of your RAM - measured in bytes (Typically in Gigabytes).

But what really is a byte? 

## Let's play a game

Imagine your friend is in a quiz show to win a humongus price - but they are stuck in a question. There are four options, and you know the answer to it. A special rule in this show allows you to communicate with your friend, but there's catch: You can only use special set of switches and light bulbs.

Imagine an ordinary switch - that can be either turned ON or OFF. They are also connected to a light bulb, so that if you turn ON the switch, it will light up the bulb.

Now imagine there are four sets of these switches and light bulbs. If you turn one switch ON, it will turn one light bulb ON. If you want to turn ON all of ten light bulbs, you must turn ON all of the switches.

Great, that's too easy. If the options are A, B, C or D, you can turn on 1, 2, 3 or 4 light bulbs 

<!-- ## Everything is 0's and 1's ...

Ok, I'm sure you've heard of this before. Everything is just 0's and 1's, and we're all in a simulation... Well you're about to find out what 0's and 1's really mean in the world of computing.

### 0's and 1's can be used to count numbers

Let's say we want to count 10 oranges. A normal person would count like this:

|One|Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|Ten|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|

Now I know this is weird, but if you include '0' as the first number, you can count 10 oranges like this:

|Zero|One|Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|

This way, you can say that a single digit can hold up to 10 numbers, that is 0~9.

Common sense? Now, imagine if you can only count up to 2 numbers in a single digit, that is 0 and 1. 

|Zero|One|
|-|-|
|0|1|

So how do we count more than 2? Well just like when we want to count more than 10 numbers, we add a second digit.

|Zero|One|Two|
|-|-|-|
|0|1|10|

Wow ok hold on. Did we just jump from one to ten? No, no we haven't. It might be better to represent it like this:

|Zero|One|Two|
|-|-|-|
|00|01|10|

If a single digit can only count up to "1". Let's go through this step by step: -->
